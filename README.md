# emberjs-clj

Mark Watson March 11, 2013

A simple Ember.js and Clojure web app template - a minimal example of making a REST call from Ember.js back to Clojure.

I plan on using Ember.js for web app front ends with Clojure + Compojure + Noir backend services. This project is intended as a short template project to start real web apps with.
Credits:

I read the book by Marc Bodmer "Instant Ember.js Application Development How-to":

http://www.packtpub.com/emberjs-application-development/book

before working through this example, and I used Marc's suggested setup for Ember.js projects.
